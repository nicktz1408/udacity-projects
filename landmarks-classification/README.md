# Landmarks Classification
This is a deep learning project related to landmarks classification.
It consists of 2 parts:
* First, I created a Convolutional Neural Network to perform the task, trained it and tested it.
* Next, I applied transfered learning. I used an existing and trained sophisticated CNN (vgg19) and trained only the final fully connected layers part to adapt it to the current dataset.
